## Tuesday, May 26 (day 1)

Today we are going to get things setup for our online class!

[Read this short blog post](https://beta.capeia.com/paleobiology/2019/09/28/braided-streams-evolutionary-dynamics-among-pleistocene-hominins-in-east-asia-and-the-evolution-of-homo-sapiens)
[and this interview](https://gizmodo.com/this-philosopher-is-challenging-all-of-evolutionary-psy-1842248835)


### create an account on Perusall (make sure to use the class code KISSEL-6N6B8 when you sign up so you get access to our site ) 

- all the class articles are there. You don't have to comment  on all of them but i ask that you do so a few times during the week at least. You can also answer or respond to other comments. This is sort of taking the place of the standard disucssion board which seems to never work very well 
- to demo Perusall, look at the first paper listed "on Love and other data." make at least one annoatin/response

### Join the class Slack

- post a Hello message. I'll be on Slack all day to help folks set things up

### Create a blog

- note: While we are doing this in the open, i know that some might not want to have their name attached. THe 4th link here talks about how to be anonymous. If you would rather do that, that is totally fine. I'll have to know which blog is yours but I'll delete all info i have after class ends. You could even setup a seperate email account when you log into Blogger if you prefer (that is what i did when i had a blog in grad school that i have since forgoteen how to log into..)

## Wednesday, May 27 - Decolonizing Human Evolution (day 2)

**Read the following articles:**

- [Athreya and Ackermann 2018 Colonialism Narratives Human Origins Asia Africa](https://osf.io/f43tr/)

```{marginfigure, echo= TRUE}

Remember you can find all of these on https://app.perusall.com/courses/human-evolution-3/_/dashboard/documents/document-36dzcicQpqSjF3J3h but if it is available online there is also a link
```

- [Dunsworth_2018_It is unethical to teach evolution without confronting racism and sexism](https://evolution-institute.org/it-is-unethical-to-teach-evolution-without-confronting-racism-and-sexism/) 
- Sterling_2015_Black Feminist Theory in Prehistory



**Now, Here's what i want you to do:**

1. Write your first blog post based on the readings. One topic could be how your previous classes have dealt w/ the issues raised in the readings, examples of how this can be done better, or simply what you thought while reading the two papers. 


```{marginfigure, echo= TRUE}

**Here's why I Want you to do it:**

We want to begin to think about who gets to tell the story of human origins.
As we all know, there is a lot of controversy about where we come from. But 
rather than center a debate about creationism (though you are free to explore
that in your post!) I thought it would be interesting to see how recent work 
is pushing against the narrative in a different way 


**Here's how to do it**
  
- Use the 3 papers (and any others you know of/can find) as a scaffold for
  the post. You don't have to reference them all and there is no set format
  for referencing
- Think about [adding visuals to your blog](https://oudigitools.blogspot.com/2020/05/images-in-posts.html)
- make sure to add the tag #Ant4320 so we can find it!

```


***Please have this posted by Friday May 29 at 5:00 pm if possible***




## Thursday, May 28 - Evolutionary theory (day 3)

**Read the following articles:**

- [Gould and Lewontin 1979 The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm-A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.1979.0086)
- [The selfish gene is a great meme. Too bad it’s so wrong](https://aeon.co/essays/the-selfish-gene-is-a-great-meme-too-bad-it-s-so-wrong)


**Now**

- make annotations on these two articles on the Persuall site. You could ask for clairifaiton on these ideas or just explore your thoughts

- Optional Zoom meeting: 

If you can make it we will be up on Zoom and Slack to talk about the articles for this week at around 1 PM - 2 PM. let me know if you want to come and we can setup a link!


## Weekend 

1. Pick a fossil from the list online () and begin to learn about it. jot down notes etc
2. Follow the directions [here to start with Aris...](need)

## Monday, June 1 - Primates (day 4)
**Read the following article:**

Primate Cognition[https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/primate-cognition-59751723/]



**Now, Here's what i want you to do:**

Write your blog post based on answering the following question:

>
> If humans came from chimps, why are there still chimps?
>


**Here's why I Want you to do it:**

This is not a dumb question nor is it easy to answer. I want you to think about how you could respond to this question in a way that is respectful and useful. We will return to this question at the end of the class as well


**Here's how to do it:**

Using your knoweldge from other classes, as well as any other sources, write a conversational response and share it on your blog. If you want, feel free to insert a video, gif, or image. You may want to look at examples of how to engage with the public and how to craft responses that are useful.


## Tuesday, June 2 - (day 5)

**Read the following articles:**


[Lovejoy 1981-The origin of man](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6092674_The_Origin_of_Man) 
[Ward et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537304)

**Now**, 

- Make comments on Persual on these papers. No set number of comments needed but engage at the level you feel is needed.

- Begin to create the Sutori site for your fossil. 


## Wednesday, June 3 (day 6)

**Read the following article:**

Brunet et al - A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa
Pickford et al - Bipedalism in Orrorin tugenensis revealed by its femora


**Now, here's what i want you to do** 

```{marginfigure, echo= TRUE}


**Here's why I Want you to do it:**
Tracing the fossil evidence is difficult and this literature is really hard to parse. By starting to keep track of something like this you can begin to build your knowledge


**Here's how to do it:**
look at one of the articles over the ast 2 days and notice what they are talking about in terms of functional aspects of bipdealism. For example, what about the femur of *Orroin* suggests it is a biped. If you need help [this site is full of awesome info](https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright) 
```


- Pick one aspect of the skeletal evidence of bipedalism and write a short blog post about it. Feel free to use Google if you need help






## Thursday, June 4 (day 7)



Watch these lectures on early hominins 



[Early Hominin Body Form](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/mediaplayer/play/5367/3264)

we can jump on Slack to watch together at a certain time or watch them by yourself and comment on slack afterwards. THe readings from the previous class should help inform o these

## Weekend

- Work on planning out your part of the game. You already have a fossil chosen so begin to find articles on it and read them



## Monday, June  8 (day 8): Ardipithecus!


watch this:

**Read the following articles:**


Pick one of the research articles below and read it in depth. 
[links to articles](https://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/ardipithecus/index.xhtml)





**Now, Here's what i want you to do:**


```{marginfigure, echo= TRUE}


**Here's why I Want you to do it:**
Arid was published 11 years ago. Since then a lot has changed but we still don't know that much about this timer period. I want you to focus on one aspect of its anatomy. You can then 'follow' that part as we continue in out understanidng of human origins


**Here's how to do it:**
As you read the article, take notes and ask questions (on Persuall might help for feedback!). Get the larger picture of what is going on in the form and fucntion. if there is a bone, element, whatevr that you dont know google it or ask in the Slack.  
```


Prepare a blog post for *Thus June 11th* on the article you read. You should do your best to summarize the article as well as talk about its signifinace and what you learned. YOu could also go further and see what recent data exists that may update what we know

# Projects


getting Aris ready

- Online game:

https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/


check out the website above and play around with it. Setup an accont and, use the [manual to make a tutorial game](https://manual.arisgames.org/home).

If you have a smart phone try to install the software (note: if you are like me and have an Android it is a bit harder. see if you can follow this but otherwise i'll work on giving a more detailed instrution. https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=169)


other useful links:

https://casls.uoregon.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/07/ARIS_in_the_classroom.pdf


ONce we plan out we will start to build it. I'll nvite everyone to join my setup one(unless someoen wants to take chage). then in teasm you will build the part you asked to do

More: we will work on this game in Slack etc.
