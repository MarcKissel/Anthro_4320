## Welcome to the course page for Anthropology 4320

Hi! This is the draft version of our course website. Feel free to look around. Most of the class reading are on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) due to copyright issues but you can use this page to find all of the other files and assignments. I don't really like AsULearn for many things but we will use it for submitting projects etc. And anything posted here will be backed up to AsULearn.
