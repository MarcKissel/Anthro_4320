# Class projects

## Your blog 

This is the main writing project for the course. You will use your blog to interact virtually  with other class members and to share your thoughts on the readings, videos, and concepts.

## Readings and annotations

We will be using the Perusall site to make annotations on our reading list.  All of the class articles are there (see the [calendar](https://marckissel.github.io/Anthro_4320/calendar.html) for a list of when to be reading them . You don't have to comment  on all of them but I ask that you do so a few times during the week at least. You can also answer or respond to other comments. This is sort of taking the place of the standard disucssion board which seems to never work very well 

To use this site, go here https://app.perusall.com  **Make sure to use the class code XXXXX when you sign up so you get access to our site**


The readings are posted on AsULearn and on Persuall. Also, the course calendar had links to **most** of the articles if i could find them online

## Slack

This is the way we will communicate about class ideas etc informally (kinda like a group chat). I'll send you all an invite this week!

## Your presentation on a fossil hominin

We will be using Sutori to create an interactive presentation on a fossil. You can pick one from the Google sheet HERE or choose your own and add it to the list. [See here for more info on using this site and creating a good presentation](https://marckissel.github.io/Anthro_4320/Sutori_presentation.html)

## Our game

This is the major group project. I admit that it might not work out perfectly but i think it will be fun to try. [Find out more here](https://marckissel.github.io/Anthro_4320/online_game_notes.html)
