  be anonymous. If you would rather do that, that is totally fine. I'll
  have to know which blog is yours but I'll delete all info i have after
  class ends. You could even setup a seperate email account when you log
  into Blogger if you prefer (that is what i did when i had a blog in

\subsection{Wednesday, May 27 - Decolonizing Human Evolution (day
2)}\label{wednesday-may-27---decolonizing-human-evolution-day-2}}

\end{itemize}

\begin{marginfigure}
\textbf{Here's why I Want you to do it:}

We want to begin to think about who gets to tell the story of human
origins. As we all know, there is a lot of controversy about where we
come from. But rather than center a debate about creationism (though you
are free to explore that in your post!) I thought it would be
interesting to see how recent work is pushing against the narrative in a
different way

\textbf{Here's how to do it:}

Use the 3 papers (and any others you know of/can find) as a scaffold for
the post. You don't have to reference them all and there is no set
format for referencing Think about
\href{https://oudigitools.blogspot.com/2020/05/images-in-posts.html}{adding
visuals to your blog} make sure to add the tag \#Ant4320 so we can find
it!

\item
  Write your first blog post based on the readings.
\end{enumerate}

One topic could be how your previous classes have dealt w/ the issues
raised in the readings, examples of how this can be done better, or
simply what you thought while reading the two papers.

\textbf{Here's why I Want you to do it:}

This is not a dumb question nor is it easy to answer. I want you to
think about how you could respond to this question in a way that is
respectful and useful. We will return to this question at the end of the
class as well

\textbf{Here's how to do it:}

Using your knoweldge from other classes, as well as any other sources,
write a conversational response and share it on your blog. If you want,
feel free to insert a video, gif, or image. You may want to look at
examples of how to engage with the public and how to craft responses
that are useful.

femur could help}

\begin{marginfigure}
\textbf{Here's why I Want you to do it:} Tracing the fossil evidence is
difficult and this literature is really hard to parse. By starting to
keep track of something like this you can begin to build your knowledge

\textbf{Here's how to do it:} look at one of the articles over the past
2 days and notice what they are talking about in terms of functional
aspects of bipdealism. For example, what about the femur of
\emph{Orroin} suggests it is a biped. If you need help
\href{https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright}{this
site is full of awesome info}. Or you could decide to look at what make
the foramen magnum relevant for bipedalism. If you need help, send me a
message on Slack!

\textbf{Now, here's what i want you to do}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pick one aspect of the skeletal evidence of bipedalism and write a
  short blog post about it. If you need more background check out the
  chapter on early hominins from Monday!

\begin{marginfigure}
\textbf{Here's why I Want you to do it:} Arid was published 11 years
ago. Since then a lot has changed but we still don't know that much
about this timer period. I want you to focus on one aspect of its
anatomy. You can then `follow' that part as we continue in out
understanidng of human origins

\textbf{Here's how to do it:} As you read the article, take notes and
ask questions (on Persuall might help for feedback!). Get the larger
picture of what is going on in the form and fucntion. if there is a
bone, element, whatevr that you dont know google it or ask in the Slack.

\textbf{Now, Here's what i want you to do:}

Prepare a blog post for \emph{Thus June 11th} on the article you read.
You should do your best to summarize the article as well as talk about
its signifinace and what you learned. YOu could also go further and see
what recent data exists that may update what we know
